# Code Style Guide

This document provides guidelines on code style, naming conventions, and best practices for the Ada Web Analyzer project.

## General Guidelines

*   Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. You can find the full guide [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
*   Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
*   Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
*   Keep functions and classes small and focused.
*   Write unit tests for all core modules.
*   Use logging for debugging and error handling.

## Python Code Style

*   Use 4 spaces for indentation.
*   Limit line length to 79 characters.
*   Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and modules.
*   Use comments to explain complex logic.
*   Follow the naming conventions:
    *   Variables: \snake_case\
    *   Functions: \snake_case\
    *   Classes: \CamelCase\
    *   Constants: \UPPER_CASE\

## Django Code Style

*   Follow Django's coding style guidelines.
*   Use Django's built-in features and utilities whenever possible.
*   Write efficient database queries.
*   Use Django's template language for rendering HTML.

## Logging and Error Handling

*   Use the \logging\ module for logging messages.
*   Use different log levels for different types of messages (e.g., \DEBUG\, \INFO\, \WARNING\, \ERROR\).
*   Handle exceptions gracefully and log any errors.
*   Provide informative error messages to the user.

## Best Practices

*   Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies.
*   Use Git for version control.
*   Write clear and concise commit messages.
*   Follow the project's branching strategy.
*   Submit pull requests for code review.
