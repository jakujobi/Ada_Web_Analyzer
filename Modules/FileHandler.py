***  DESCRIPTION :                                                 ***
***  This module defines a FileHandler class that manages various   ***
***  file operations. It is used by multiple programs to handle     ***
***  tasks such as finding, opening, reading, writing, and appending  ***
***  to files. It supports both command-line file names and interactive***
***  input, including using a GUI file explorer (if Tkinter is available). ***
***                                                                  ***
***  The FileHandler class includes the following methods:         ***
***                                                                  ***
***  - process_file(file_name):                                    ***
***      Finds the file, opens it, reads it line by line, and returns ***
***      a list of cleaned lines. If an error occurs, returns None.  ***
***                                                                  ***
***  - process_arg_file(file_name):                                ***
***      Processes a file provided as a command-line argument.      ***
***                                                                  ***
***  - find_file(file_name, create_if_missing=False):              ***
***      Checks if the file exists in the main program directory.  ***
***      If not found, prompts the user for the file path or lets the ***
***      user use the system file explorer to locate it.            ***
***                                                                  ***
***  - prompt_for_file(file_name):                                 ***
***      Interactively prompts the user to type in a file path or     ***
***      select one via the system file explorer (if available).      ***
***                                                                  ***
***  - handle_invalid_input(question, retry_limit):                ***
***      Handles invalid responses during interactive input with a   ***
***      retry mechanism.                                            ***
***                                                                  ***
***  - open_file(file_path):                                       ***
***      Opens the file in read mode and yields each line one at a   ***
***      time using a generator (so large files arenâ€™t fully loaded).***
***                                                                  ***
***  - read_file(file):                                            ***
***      Reads from a file generator line by line, cleans each line,  ***
***      and returns a list of non-empty, cleaned lines.             ***
***                                                                  ***
***  - read_file_raw(file_name):                                   ***
***      Reads the entire file into a list of raw lines without       ***
***      additional processing.                                      ***
***                                                                  ***
***  - process_file_char_stream(file_name):                        ***
***      Reads the file character by character using a generator.    ***
***                                                                  ***
***  - read_file_as_string(file_name):                             ***
***      Reads the entire file and returns its contents as a single   ***
***      string.                                                     ***
***                                                                  ***
***  - use_system_explorer():                                      ***
***      Opens a system file explorer window using Tkinter (if        ***
***      available) so the user can select a file interactively.       ***
***                                                                  ***
***  - read_line_from_file(line):                                  ***
***      Cleans an individual line by removing extra spaces and any  ***
***      inline comments (everything after '//'). Skips empty lines.   ***
***                                                                  ***

"""
Class: FileHandler
------------------
The FileHandler class is a comprehensive utility for handling file operations within
the compiler project. It is used by various programs to perform tasks such as:

  - **Finding Files:** It checks the main program directory for a given file. If the file is not found,
    it can prompt the user to manually enter a file path or use a system file explorer.
  
  - **Reading Files:** The class provides methods to:
       * Read the file line by line using generators (e.g., open_file()) to conserve memory.
       * Read the file fully into a string (read_file_as_string()).
       * Read the file into a list of raw or processed lines (read_file() and read_file_raw()).
       * Process a file as a character stream (process_file_char_stream()).
  
  - **Writing and Appending Files:** Methods like write_file(), write_string_to_file(), and append_to_file()
    enable writing or appending data to files, creating the file if necessary.
  
  - **User Interaction:** For cases where the file isn't found automatically, prompt_for_file() and
    handle_invalid_input() provide an interactive mechanism to obtain a valid file path from the user.
  
  - **System File Explorer Integration:** If Tkinter is available, use_system_explorer() allows the user
    to visually select a file.
  
  - **Line Processing:** read_line_from_file() cleans individual lines by removing extra whitespace
    and inline comments.

This class is thoroughly documented so that any programmer, even a beginner, can understand how to
use its methods in various parts of the application.
